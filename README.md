## Installation
To install, clone or fork from my repo, then launch your server using the command 'node start'. Once your server is live, open whatever tool you use to test API routes. To create Users, Thoughts, and Reactions, check out the schema in the models - this will allow you to create the required data to test all of the API routes. 

## Usage
Social Media API is a simple blueprint for the creation of many social media applications. This can be used as a reference or launch pad to get your application started quickly.
